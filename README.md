# MLMovies
This is an AI project that determines if a movie review is positive or negative
## Data Source
The data used to train and test the model is from IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews
## How to test your own review
You can test your own review by uploading your text file if you're using an online notebook or ide and copying file path to:
df1 = pd.read_csv('your file path here')
or if you have a local ide or notebook you can just copy the file path directly without upload.
